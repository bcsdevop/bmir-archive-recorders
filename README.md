# Internet Radio Archive Recorders

This project contains the scripts to install and configure several different internet radio archive recorders used at Burning Man Information Radio (BMIR 94.5 FM), at the annual Burning Man festival, in Black Rock City, Nevada, USA.

Several tools and techniques are used to record the archives each year.  This github project was created to store the scripts for safe-keeping.

## Studio Icecast

This directory contains scripts to install and configure an Icecast Server and Streamripper listener on Ubuntu 16.04. These two processes run on a standalone computer in the studio.  Studio broadcast equipment 'uploads' the music stream to this icecast server.  Streamripper 'listens' to the stream from icecast and records it to mp3 files.

This technique is new and experimental at Burning Man 2017.
