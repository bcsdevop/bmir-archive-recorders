# BMIR Internet Radio Archive Recorders

This project contains the scripts to install and configure several different internet radio archive recorders used at Burning Man Information Radio (BMIR 94.5 FM), at the annual Burning Man festival, in Black Rock City, Nevada, USA.

Several tools and techniques have been used to record the archives over the years.  As they have grown more diverse and complicated, his github project was created to store and share the scripts.

## Studio Icecast

This directory contains scripts to install and configure an Icecast Server and Streamripper listener on Ubuntu 16.04.

These two processes will run on one standalone computer in the studio.  Broadcast equipment will 'upload' a digitized music stream to this icecast server (in addition to uploading to several music servers on the public internet.).  Streamripper 'listens' to the stream from icecast and records it to mp3 files.

This technique is new and experimental at Burning Man 2017.
